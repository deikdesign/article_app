makes it easy to use the JavaScript pre-processor and bundler\n[webpack 4.x.x+](https://webpack.js.org/)\nto manage application-like JavaScript in Rails. It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x. Please refer to [3-x-stable](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/tree/3-x-stable) branch for 3.x documentation.\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Usage](#usage)\n  - [Development](#development)\n  - [Webpack Configuration](#webpack-configuration)\n  - [Custom Rails environments](#custom-rails-environments)\n  - [Upgrading](#upgrading)\n  - [Yarn Integrity](#yarn-integrity)\n- [Integrations](#integrations)\n  - [React](#react)\n  - [Angular with TypeScript](#angular-with-typescript)\n  - [Vue](#vue)\n  - [Elm](#elm)\n  - [Stimulus](#stimulus)\n  - [Coffeescript](#coffeescript)\n  - [Erb](#erb)\n- [Paths](#paths)\n  - [Resolved](#resolved)\n  - [Watched](#watched)\n- [Deployment](#deployment)\n- [Docs](#docs)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Ruby 2.2+\n* Rails 4.2+\n* Node.js 6.14.0+\n* Yarn 1.x+\n\n\n## Features\n\n* [webpack 4.x.x](https://webpack.js.org/)\n* ES6 with [babel](https://babeljs.io/)\n* Automatic code splitting using multiple entry points\n* Stylesheets - Sass and CSS\n* Images and fonts\n* PostCSS - Auto-Prefixer\n* Asset compression, source-maps, and minification\n* CDN support\n* React, Angular, Elm and Vue support out-of-the-box\n* Rails view helpers\n* Extensible and configurable\n\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can either add Webpacker during setup of a new Rails 5.1+ application\nusing new `--webpack` option:\n\n```bash\n# Available Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack\n```\n\nOr add it to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\ngem 'webpacker', '~> 3.5'\n\n# OR if you prefer to use master\ngem 'webpacker', git: 'https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git'\nyarn add https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git\n\n# OR to try out 4.x pre-release\ngem 'webpacker', '>= 4.0.x'\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@4.0.0-pre.2\n```\n\nFinally, run the following to install Webpacker:\n\n```bash\nbundle\nbundle exec rails webpacker:install\n\n# OR (on rails version < 5.0)\nbundle exec rake webpacker:install\n```\n\nOptional: To fix [\"unmet peer dependency\" warnings](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1078),\n\n```bash\nyarn upgrade\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can start writing modern ES6-flavored JavaScript apps right away:\n\n```yml\napp/javascript:\n  ├── packs:\n  │   # only webpack entry files here\n  │   └── application.js\n  └── src:\n  │   └── application.css\n  └── images:\n      └── logo.svg\n```\n\nYou can then link the JavaScript pack in Rails views using the `javascript_pack_tag` helper.\nIf you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_pack_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<link rel=\"prefetch\">` or `<img />` tag, you\ncan use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n\n```erb\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'application.css' %>\" />\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file.\n\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production` or `development`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^2.11.1\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@4.0.0-pre.2\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more

makes it easy to use the JavaScript pre-processor and bundler\n[webpack 4.x.x+](https://webpack.js.org/)\nto manage application-like JavaScript in Rails. It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x. Please refer to [3-x-stable](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/tree/3-x-stable) branch for 3.x documentation.\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Usage](#usage)\n  - [Development](#development)\n  - [Webpack Configuration](#webpack-configuration)\n  - [Custom Rails environments](#custom-rails-environments)\n  - [Upgrading](#upgrading)\n  - [Yarn Integrity](#yarn-integrity)\n- [Integrations](#integrations)\n  - [React](#react)\n  - [Angular with TypeScript](#angular-with-typescript)\n  - [Vue](#vue)\n  - [Elm](#elm)\n  - [Stimulus](#stimulus)\n  - [Coffeescript](#coffeescript)\n  - [Erb](#erb)\n- [Paths](#paths)\n  - [Resolved](#resolved)\n  - [Watched](#watched)\n- [Deployment](#deployment)\n- [Docs](#docs)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Ruby 2.2+\n* Rails 4.2+\n* Node.js 6.14.4+\n* Yarn 1.x+\n\n\n## Features\n\n* [webpack 4.x.x](https://webpack.js.org/)\n* ES6 with [babel](https://babeljs.io/)\n* Automatic code splitting using multiple entry points\n* Stylesheets - Sass and CSS\n* Images and fonts\n* PostCSS - Auto-Prefixer\n* Asset compression, source-maps, and minification\n* CDN support\n* React, Angular, Elm and Vue support out-of-the-box\n* Rails view helpers\n* Extensible and configurable\n\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can either add Webpacker during setup of a new Rails 5.1+ application\nusing new `--webpack` option:\n\n```bash\n# Available Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack\n```\n\nOr add it to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\ngem 'webpacker', '~> 3.5'\n\n# OR if you prefer to use master\ngem 'webpacker', git: 'https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git'\nyarn add https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git\n\n# OR to try out 4.x pre-release\ngem 'webpacker', '>= 4.0.x'\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\nFinally, run the following to install Webpacker:\n\n```bash\nbundle\nbundle exec rails webpacker:install\n\n# OR (on rails version < 5.0)\nbundle exec rake webpacker:install\n```\n\nOptional: To fix [\"unmet peer dependency\" warnings](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1078),\n\n```bash\nyarn upgrade\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can start writing modern ES6-flavored JavaScript apps right away:\n\n```yml\napp/javascript:\n  ├── packs:\n  │   # only webpack entry files here\n  │   └── application.js\n  └── src:\n  │   └── application.css\n  └── images:\n      └── logo.svg\n```\n\nYou can then link the JavaScript pack in Rails views using the `javascript_pack_tag` helper.\nIf you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_pack_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<link rel=\"prefetch\">` or `<img />` tag, you\ncan use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n\n```erb\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'application.css' %>\" />\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file.\n\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^2.11.1\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more detailed guides under [docs](./docs).\n\n\n## Contributing\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x.

This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^2.11.1\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more detailed guides under [docs](./docs).\n\n\n## Contributing\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x.

This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^3.1.14\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more detailed guides under [docs](./docs).\n\n\n## Contributing\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x.

This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^3.1.14\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more detailed guides under [docs](./docs).\n\n\n## Contributing\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x.

This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^3.1.14\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more detailed guides under [docs](./docs).\n\n\n## Contributing\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x.

This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^3.1.14\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more detailed guides under [docs](./docs).\n\n\n## Contributing\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x.

This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^3.1.14\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more detailed guides under [docs](./docs).\n\n\n## Contributing\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v4.x.x.

This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn add webpack-dev-server@^3.1.14\n\n# Or to install a latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n### Yarn Integrity\n\nBy default, in development, webpacker runs a yarn integrity check to ensure that all local JavaScript packages are up-to-date. This is similar to what bundler does currently in Rails, but for JavaScript packages. If your system is out of date, then Rails will not initialize. You will be asked to upgrade your local JavaScript packages by running `yarn install`.\n\nTo turn off this option, you will need to change the default setting in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  ...\n  # Verifies that versions and hashed value of the package contents in the project's package.json\n  check_yarn_integrity: false\n```\n\nYou may also turn on this feature by adding the config option for any Rails environment in `config/webpacker.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n  check_yarn_integrity: true\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration for React, Angular, Vue and Elm.\nYou can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`:\n\n### React\n\nTo use Webpacker with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=react` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=react\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` in a existing Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add all relevant dependencies using Yarn, changes\nto the configuration files, and an example React component to your\nproject in `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with React right away.\n\n\n### Angular with TypeScript\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Angular](https://angular.io/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=angular` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=angular\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:angular` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add the TypeScript and Angular core libraries using Yarn alongside\na few changes to the configuration files. An example component written in\nTypeScript will also be added to your project in `app/javascript` so that\nyou can experiment with Angular right away.\n\nBy default, Angular uses a JIT compiler for development environment. This\ncompiler is not compatible with restrictive CSP (Content Security\nPolicy) environments like Rails 5.2+. You can use Angular AOT compiler\nin development with the [@ngtools/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#usage) plugin.\n\nAlternatively if you're using Rails 5.2+ you can enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your\ndevelopment environment. This can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`\nwith the following code:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Vue\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=vue` option:\n\n```bash\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=vue\n```\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:vue` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe installer will add Vue and its required libraries using Yarn alongside\nautomatically applying changes needed to the configuration files. An example component will\nbe added to your project in `app/javascript` so that you can experiment with Vue right away.\n\nIf you're using Rails 5.2+ you'll need to enable `unsafe-eval` rule for your development environment.\nThis can be done in the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with the following\nconfiguration:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  if Rails.env.development?\n    policy.script_src :self, :https, :unsafe_eval\n  else\n    policy.script_src :self, :https\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can read more about this in the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CSP-environments).\n\n\n### Elm\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=elm` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=elm\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:elm` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nThe Elm library and its core packages will be added via Yarn and Elm.\nAn example `Main.elm` app will also be added to your project in `app/javascript`\nso that you can experiment with Elm right away.\n\n### Stimulus\n\nTo use Webpacker with [Stimulus](http://stimulusjs.org), create a\nnew Rails 5.1+ app using `--webpack=stimulus` option:\n\n```\n# Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack=stimulus\n```\n\n(or run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:stimulus` on a Rails app already setup with Webpacker).\n\nPlease read [The Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction) or learn more about its source code at https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus\n\n### Coffeescript\n\nTo add [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) support,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:coffee` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_coffee.coffee` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Coffeescript right away.\n\n### Erb\n\nTo add [Erb](https://apidock.com/ruby/ERB) support in your JS templates,\nrun `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb` on a Rails app already\nsetup with Webpacker.\n\nAn example `hello_erb.js.erb` file will also be added to your project\nin `app/javascript/packs` so that you can experiment with Erb-flavoured\njavascript right away.\n\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `resolved_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nresolved_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n\n### Watched\n\nBy default, the lazy compilation is cached until a file is changed under your\ntracked paths. You can configure which paths are tracked\nby adding new paths to `watched_paths` array. This is much like Rails' `autoload_paths`:\n\n```rb\n# config/initializers/webpacker.rb\n# or config/application.rb\nWebpacker::Compiler.watched_paths << 'bower_components'\n```\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\n\n## Docs\n\nYou can find more detailed guides under [docs](./docs).\n\n\n## Contributing\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

makes it easy to use the JavaScript pre-processor and bundler\n[webpack 4.x.x+](https://webpack.js.org/)\nto manage application-like JavaScript in Rails. It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v6.x.x. Please refer to [5-x-stable](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/tree/5-x-stable) branch for 5.x documentation.\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  -

Sass and CSS\n- Images and fonts\n- PostCSS - Auto-Prefixer\n- Asset compression, source-maps, and minification\n- CDN support\n- React, Angular, Elm and Vue support out-of-the-box\n- Rails view helpers\n- Extensible and configurable\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can either add Webpacker during setup of a new Rails 5.1+ application\nusing new `--webpack` option:\n\n```bash\n# Available Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack\n```\n\nOr add it to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\ngem 'webpacker', '~> 5.x'\n\n# OR if you prefer to use master\ngem 'webpacker', git: 'https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git'\nyarn add https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git\nyarn add core-js regenerator-runtime\n```\n\nFinally, run the following to install Webpacker:\n\n```bash\nbundle\nbundle exec rails webpacker:install\n\n# OR (on rails version < 5.0)\nbundle exec rake webpacker:install\n```\n\nOptional: To fix [\"unmet peer dependency\" warnings](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1078),\n\n```bash\nyarn upgrade\n```\n\nWhen `package.json` and/or `yarn.lock` changes, such as when pulling down changes to your local environment in a team settings, be sure to keep your NPM packages up-to-date:\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can start writing modern ES6-flavored JavaScript apps right away:\n\n```yml\napp/javascript:\n  ├── packs:\n  │   # only webpack entry files here\n  │   └── application.js\n  │   └── application.css\n  └── src:\n  │   └── my_component.js\n  └── stylesheets:\n  │   └── my_styles.css\n  └── images:\n      └── logo.svg\n```\n\nIn `/packs/application.js`, include this at the top of the file:\n\n```js\nimport 'core-js/stable'\nimport 'regenerator-runtime/runtime'\n```\n\nYou can then link the JavaScript pack in Rails views using the `javascript_pack_tag` helper.\nIf you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_pack_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<link rel=\"prefetch\">` or `<img />` tag, you\ncan use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n\n```erb\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'application.css' %>\" />\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\nIf you are using new webpack 4 split chunks API, then consider using `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag` helper, which creates html\ntags for a pack and all the dependent chunks.\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar', 'map', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>\n\n<script src=\"/packs/vendor-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/calendar~runtime-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/calendar-1016838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/map~runtime-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/map-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n```\n\n**Important:** Pass all your pack names when using `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag`\nhelper otherwise you will get duplicated chunks on the page.\n\n```erb\n<%# DO %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar', 'map' %>\n\n<%# DON'T %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar' %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'map' %>\n```\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file.\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:install\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn upgrade webpack-dev-server --latest\n\n# Or to install the latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration. You can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`.\n\nIncluded install integrations:\n\n- [React](./docs/integrations.md#React)\n- [Angular with TypeScript](./docs/integrations.md#Angular-with-TypeScript)\n- [Vue](./docs/integrations.md#Vue)\n- [Elm](./docs/integrations.md#Elm)\n- [Svelte](./docs/integrations.md#Svelte)\n- [Stimulus](./docs/integrations.md#Stimulus)\n- [CoffeeScript](./docs/integrations.md#CoffeeScript)\n- [Typescript](./docs/typescript.md)\n- [Erb](./docs/integrations.md#Erb)\n\nSee [Integrations](./docs/integrations.md) for further details.\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `additional_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nadditional_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\nWhen compiling assets for production on a remote server, such as a continuous integration environment, it's recommended to use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install NPM packages on the remote host to ensure that the installed packages match the `yarn.lock` file.\n\n## Docs\n\n- [Development](https://github.com/rails/webpacker#development)\n  - [Webpack](./docs/webpack.md)\n  - [Webpack-dev-server](./docs/webpack-dev-server.md)\n  - [Environment Variables](./docs/env.md)\n  - [Folder Structure](./docs/folder-structure.md)\n  - [Assets](./docs/assets.md) - [CSS, Sass and SCSS](./docs/css.md) - [ES6](./docs/es6.md), [Target browsers](./docs/target.md)\n    - [Props](./docs/props.md)\n    - [Typescript](./docs/typescript.md)\n  - [Yarn](./docs/yarn.md)\n  - [Misc](./docs/misc.md)\n- [Deployment](./docs/deployment.md)\n  - [Docker](./docs/docker.md)\n  - [Using in Rails engines](./docs/engines.md)\n  - [Webpacker on Cloud9](./docs/cloud9.md)\n- [Testing](./docs/testing.md)\n- [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md)\n- [v3 to v4 Upgrade Guide](./docs/v4-upgrade.md)\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v6.x.x.

If you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_packs_with_chunks_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_packs_with_chunks_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<link rel=\"prefetch\">` or `<img />` tag, you\ncan use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n\n```erb\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'application.css' %>\" />\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file.\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nWebpacker gives you a default set of configuration files for test, development and\nproduction environments in `config/webpack/*.js`. You can configure each individual\nenvironment in their respective files or configure them all in the base\n`config/webpack/environment.js` file.\n\nBy default, you don't need to make any changes to `config/webpack/*.js`\nfiles since it's all standard production-ready configuration. However,\nif you do need to customize or add a new loader, this is where you would go.\n\nHere is how you can modify webpack configuration:\n\nYou might add separate files to keep your code more organized.\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/custom.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      jquery: 'jquery/src/jquery',\n      vue: 'vue/dist/vue.js',\n      React: 'react',\n      ReactDOM: 'react-dom',\n      vue_resource: 'vue-resource/dist/vue-resource'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen `require` this file in your `config/webpack/base.js`:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst customConfig = require('./custom')\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)\n```\n\nIf you need access to configs within Webpacker's configuration,\nyou can import them like so:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig } = require('@rails/webpacker')\n\nconsole.log(webpackConfig.output_path)\nconsole.log(webpackConfig.source_path)\n```\n\n### Integrations\n\nWebpacker out of the box supports JS and static assets (fonts, images etc.)\ncompilation. To enable support for Coffeescript or Typescript install\nrelevant packages,\n\n**Coffeescript**\n\n```\nyarn add coffeescript coffee-loader\n```\n\n**Typescript**\n\n```\nyarn add typescript @babel/preset-typescript\n```\n\nAdd tsconfig.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"],\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"*\": [\"node_modules/*\", \"app/javascript/*\"]\n    },\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"noEmit\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\", \"node_modules\", \"vendor\", \"public\"],\n  \"compileOnSave\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\nTo enable CSS support in your application, add following packages,\n\n```\nyarn add css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin css-minimizer-webpack-plugin\n```\n\noptionally, add css extension to webpack config for easy resolution\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst customConfig = {\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: ['.css']\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)\n```\n\nTo enable postcss, sass or less support, add css support first and\nthen add the relevant pre-processors:\n\n#### Postcss\n\n```\nyarn add postcss-loader\n```\n\n#### Sass\n\n```\nyarn add sass-loader\n```\n\n#### Less\n\n```\nyarn add less-loader\n```\n\n#### React\n\nReact is supported and you just need to add relevant packages,\n\n```\nyarn add react react-dom @babel/preset-react\n```\n\nif you are using typescript, update your `tsconfig.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"],\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"jsx\": \"react\",\n    \"noEmit\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\", \"node_modules\", \"vendor\", \"public\"],\n  \"compileOnSave\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### Other frameworks\n\nPlease follow webpack integration guide for relevant framework or library,\n\n1. Svelte - https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader#install\n2. Angular - https://v2.angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html#!#configure-webpack\n3. Vue - https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/\n\nFor example to add Vue support,\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/rules/vue.js\nconst VueLoaderPlugin = require('vue-loader/lib/plugin')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.vue$/,\n        loader: 'vue-loader'\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [new VueLoaderPlugin()]\n}\n\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst vueConfig = require('./rules/vue')\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, vueConfig)\n```\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:install\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn upgrade webpack-dev-server --latest\n\n# Or to install the latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n### Additional paths\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `additional_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nadditional_paths: ['app/assets/**/*', 'vendor/assets/**/*.css', 'Gemfile']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\nWhen compiling assets for production on a remote server, such as a continuous integration environment, it's recommended to use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install NPM packages on the remote host to ensure that the installed packages match the `yarn.lock` file.\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v6.x.x.

If you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_packs_with_chunks_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_packs_with_chunks_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<link rel=\"prefetch\">` or `<img />` tag, you\ncan use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n\n```erb\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'application.css' %>\" />\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file.\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nWebpacker gives you a default set of configuration files for test, development and\nproduction environments in `config/webpack/*.js`. You can configure each individual\nenvironment in their respective files or configure them all in the base\n`config/webpack/environment.js` file.\n\nBy default, you don't need to make any changes to `config/webpack/*.js`\nfiles since it's all standard production-ready configuration. However,\nif you do need to customize or add a new loader, this is where you would go.\n\nHere is how you can modify webpack configuration:\n\nYou might add separate files to keep your code more organized.\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/custom.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      jquery: 'jquery/src/jquery',\n      vue: 'vue/dist/vue.js',\n      React: 'react',\n      ReactDOM: 'react-dom',\n      vue_resource: 'vue-resource/dist/vue-resource'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen `require` this file in your `config/webpack/base.js`:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst customConfig = require('./custom')\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)\n```\n\nIf you need access to configs within Webpacker's configuration,\nyou can import them like so:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig } = require('@rails/webpacker')\n\nconsole.log(webpackConfig.output_path)\nconsole.log(webpackConfig.source_path)\n```\n\n### Integrations\n\nWebpacker out of the box supports JS and static assets (fonts, images etc.)\ncompilation. To enable support for Coffeescript or Typescript install\nrelevant packages,\n\n**Coffeescript**\n\n```\nyarn add coffeescript coffee-loader\n```\n\n**Typescript**\n\n```\nyarn add typescript @babel/preset-typescript\n```\n\nAdd tsconfig.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"],\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"*\": [\"node_modules/*\", \"app/javascript/*\"]\n    },\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"noEmit\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\", \"node_modules\", \"vendor\", \"public\"],\n  \"compileOnSave\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\nTo enable CSS support in your application, add following packages,\n\n```\nyarn add css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin css-minimizer-webpack-plugin\n```\n\noptionally, add css extension to webpack config for easy resolution\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst customConfig = {\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: ['.css']\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)\n```\n\nTo enable postcss, sass or less support, add css support first and\nthen add the relevant pre-processors:\n\n#### Postcss\n\n```\nyarn add postcss-loader\n```\n\n#### Sass\n\n```\nyarn add sass-loader\n```\n\n#### Less\n\n```\nyarn add less-loader\n```\n\n#### React\n\nReact is supported and you just need to add relevant packages,\n\n```\nyarn add react react-dom @babel/preset-react\n```\n\nif you are using typescript, update your `tsconfig.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"],\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"jsx\": \"react\",\n    \"noEmit\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\", \"node_modules\", \"vendor\", \"public\"],\n  \"compileOnSave\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### Other frameworks\n\nPlease follow webpack integration guide for relevant framework or library,\n\n1. Svelte - https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader#install\n2. Angular - https://v2.angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html#!#configure-webpack\n3. Vue - https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/\n\nFor example to add Vue support,\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/rules/vue.js\nconst VueLoaderPlugin = require('vue-loader/lib/plugin')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.vue$/,\n        loader: 'vue-loader'\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [new VueLoaderPlugin()]\n}\n\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst vueConfig = require('./rules/vue')\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, vueConfig)\n```\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:install\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn upgrade webpack-dev-server --latest\n\n# Or to install the latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n### Additional paths\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `additional_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nadditional_paths: ['app/assets/**/*', 'vendor/assets/**/*.css', 'Gemfile']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\nWhen compiling assets for production on a remote server, such as a continuous integration environment, it's recommended to use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install NPM packages on the remote host to ensure that the installed packages match the `yarn.lock` file.\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v6.x.x.

If you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_packs_with_chunks_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_packs_with_chunks_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<link rel=\"prefetch\">` or `<img />` tag, you\ncan use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n\n```erb\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'application.css' %>\" />\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file.\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nWebpacker gives you a default set of configuration files for test, development and\nproduction environments in `config/webpack/*.js`. You can configure each individual\nenvironment in their respective files or configure them all in the base\n`config/webpack/environment.js` file.\n\nBy default, you don't need to make any changes to `config/webpack/*.js`\nfiles since it's all standard production-ready configuration. However,\nif you do need to customize or add a new loader, this is where you would go.\n\nHere is how you can modify webpack configuration:\n\nYou might add separate files to keep your code more organized.\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/custom.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      jquery: 'jquery/src/jquery',\n      vue: 'vue/dist/vue.js',\n      React: 'react',\n      ReactDOM: 'react-dom',\n      vue_resource: 'vue-resource/dist/vue-resource'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen `require` this file in your `config/webpack/base.js`:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst customConfig = require('./custom')\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)\n```\n\nIf you need access to configs within Webpacker's configuration,\nyou can import them like so:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig } = require('@rails/webpacker')\n\nconsole.log(webpackConfig.output_path)\nconsole.log(webpackConfig.source_path)\n```\n\n### Integrations\n\nWebpacker out of the box supports JS and static assets (fonts, images etc.)\ncompilation. To enable support for Coffeescript or Typescript install\nrelevant packages,\n\n**Coffeescript**\n\n```\nyarn add coffeescript coffee-loader\n```\n\n**Typescript**\n\n```\nyarn add typescript @babel/preset-typescript\n```\n\nAdd tsconfig.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"],\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"*\": [\"node_modules/*\", \"app/javascript/*\"]\n    },\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"noEmit\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\", \"node_modules\", \"vendor\", \"public\"],\n  \"compileOnSave\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\nTo enable CSS support in your application, add following packages,\n\n```\nyarn add css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin css-minimizer-webpack-plugin\n```\n\noptionally, add css extension to webpack config for easy resolution\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst customConfig = {\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: ['.css']\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)\n```\n\nTo enable postcss, sass or less support, add css support first and\nthen add the relevant pre-processors:\n\n#### Postcss\n\n```\nyarn add postcss-loader\n```\n\n#### Sass\n\n```\nyarn add sass sass-loader\n```\n\n#### Less\n\n```\nyarn add less less-loader\n```\n\n#### Less\n\n```\nyarn add stylus stylus-loader\n```\n\n#### React\n\nReact is supported and you just need to add relevant packages,\n\n```\nyarn add react react-dom @babel/preset-react\n```\n\nif you are using typescript, update your `tsconfig.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"],\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"jsx\": \"react\",\n    \"noEmit\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\", \"node_modules\", \"vendor\", \"public\"],\n  \"compileOnSave\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### Other frameworks\n\nPlease follow webpack integration guide for relevant framework or library,\n\n1. Svelte - https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader#install\n2. Angular - https://v2.angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html#!#configure-webpack\n3. Vue - https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/\n\nFor example to add Vue support,\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/rules/vue.js\nconst VueLoaderPlugin = require('vue-loader/lib/plugin')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.vue$/,\n        loader: 'vue-loader'\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [new VueLoaderPlugin()]\n}\n\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst vueConfig = require('./rules/vue')\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, vueConfig)\n```\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:install\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn upgrade webpack-dev-server --latest\n\n# Or to install the latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n### Additional paths\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `additional_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nadditional_paths: ['app/assets/**/*', 'vendor/assets/**/*.css', 'Gemfile']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\nWhen compiling assets for production on a remote server, such as a continuous integration environment, it's recommended to use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install NPM packages on the remote host to ensure that the installed packages match the `yarn.lock` file.\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

makes it easy to use the JavaScript pre-processor and bundler\n[Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org/)\nto manage application-like JavaScript in Rails. It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v6.x.x. Please refer to [5-x-stable](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/tree/5-x-stable) branch for 5.x documentation.\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Usage](#usage)\n  - [Development](#development)\n  - [Webpack Configuration](#webpack-configuration)\n  - [Custom Rails environments](#custom-rails-environments)\n  - [Upgrading](#upgrading)\n- [Paths](#paths)\n  - [Resolved](#resolved)\n  - [Watched](#watched)\n- [Deployment](#deployment)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Ruby 2.4+\n- Rails 5.2+\n- Node.js 10.22.1+ || 12+ || 14+\n- Yarn 1.x+ || 2.x+\n\n## Features\n\n- [Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org/)\n- ES6 with [babel](https://babeljs.io/)\n- Automatic code splitting using multiple entry points\n- Asset compression, source-maps, and minification\n- CDN support\n- Rails view helpers\n- Extensible and configurable\n\n### Optional support\n\n  _requires extra packages to be installed_\n\n  - Stylesheets - Sass, Less, Stylus and Css, PostCSS\n  - CoffeeScript\n  - TypeScript\n  - React\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can either add Webpacker during setup of a new Rails 5.1+ application\nusing new `--webpack` option:\n\n```bash\n# Available Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack\n```\n\nOr add it to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\ngem 'webpacker', '~> 6.x'\n\n# OR if you prefer to use master\ngem 'webpacker', git: 'https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git'\nyarn add https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git\n```\n\nFinally, run the following to install Webpacker:\n\n```bash\nbundle\nbundle exec rails webpacker:install\n\n# OR (on rails version < 5.0)\nbundle exec rake webpacker:install\n```\n\nOptional: To fix [\"unmet peer dependency\" warnings](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1078),\n\n```bash\nyarn upgrade\n```\n\nWhen `package.json` and/or `yarn.lock` changes, such as when pulling down changes to your local environment in a team settings, be sure to keep your NPM packages up-to-date:\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can start writing modern ES6-flavored JavaScript apps right away:\n\n```yml\napp/packs:\n  ├── entrypoints:\n  │   # Only Webpack entry files here\n  │   └── application.js\n  │   └── application.css\n  └── src:\n  │   └── my_component.js\n  └── stylesheets:\n  │   └── my_styles.css\n  └── images:\n      └── logo.svg\n```\n\nYou can then link the JavaScript pack in Rails views using the `javascript_pack_tag` helper. If you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_pack_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<img />` tag, you can use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n```erb\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\nOr use the dedicated helper:\n```erb\n<%= image_pack_tag 'application.png', size: '16x10', alt: 'Edit Entry' %>\n<%= image_pack_tag 'picture.png', srcset: { 'picture-2x.png' => '2x' } %>\n```\n\nIf you want to create a favicon:\n```erb\n<%= favicon_pack_tag 'mb-icon.png', rel: 'apple-touch-icon', type: 'image/png' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to preload a static asset in your `<head>`, you can use the `preload_pack_asset` helper:\n```erb\n<%= preload_pack_asset 'fonts/fa-regular-400.woff2' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to use images in your stylesheets:\n\n```css\n.foo {\n  background-image: url('../images/logo.svg')\n}\n```\n\nNote, if you are using server-side rendering of JavaScript with dynamic code-spliting,\nas is often done with extensions to Webpacker, like [React on Rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails)\nyour JavaScript should create the link prefetch HTML tags that you will use, so you won't\nneed to use to `asset_pack_path` in those circumstances.\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file. Otherwise, Webpack won't know\nto package up those files.\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log. However, this auto-compilation happens when a web request\nis made that requires an updated webpack build, not when files change. Thus, that can\nbe painfully slow for front-end development in this default way. Instead, you should either\nrun the `bin/webpack --watch` or run `./bin/webpack-dev-server`\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nWindows users will need to run these commands in a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`.\nThis process will watch for changes in the `app/packs/entrypoints/*.js` files and automatically\nreload the browser to match. This feature is also known as\n[Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/).\n\nHMR is only the first step to running \"Fast Refresh\" with React. For more information\non how to configure rails/webpacker for Fast Refresh with React, see article\n[HMR and React Hot Reloading](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/docs/rails-webpacker-react-integration-options.md#hmr-and-react-hot-reloading).\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this webpack development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop this server, Rails will detect\nthat it's not running and Rails will revert back to on-demand compilation _if_ you have\nthe `compile` option set to true in your `config/webpacker.yml`\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nWebpacker gives you a default set of configuration files for test, development and\nproduction environments in `config/webpack/*.js`. You can configure each individual\nenvironment in their respective files or configure them all in the base\n`config/webpack/base.js` file.\n\nBy default, you don't need to make any changes to `config/webpack/*.js`\nfiles since it's all standard production-ready configuration. However,\nif you do need to customize or add a new loader, this is where you would go.\n\nHere is how you can modify webpack configuration:\n\nYou might add separate files to keep your code more organized.\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/custom.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      jquery: 'jquery/src/jquery',\n      vue: 'vue/dist/vue.js',\n      React: 'react',\n      ReactDOM: 'react-dom',\n      vue_resource: 'vue-resource/dist/vue-resource'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen `require` this file in your `config/webpack/base.js`:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst customConfig = require('./custom')\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)\n```\n\nIf you need access to configs within Webpacker's configuration,\nyou can import them like so:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig } = require('@rails/webpacker')\n\nconsole.log(webpackConfig.output_path)\nconsole.log(webpackConfig.source_path)\n\n// Or to print out your whole webpack configuration\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(webpackConfig, undefined, 2))\n```\n\n### Integrations\n\nWebpacker out of the box supports JS and static assets (fonts, images etc.)\ncompilation. To enable support for CoffeeScript or TypeScript install\nrelevant packages:\n\n#### CoffeeScript\n\n```bash\nyarn add coffeescript coffee-loader\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\n```bash\nyarn add typescript @babel/preset-typescript\n```\n\nAdd tsconfig.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"],\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"*\": [\"node_modules/*\", \"app/packs/*\"]\n    },\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"noEmit\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\", \"node_modules\", \"vendor\", \"public\"],\n  \"compileOnSave\": false\n}\n```\n\nBabel won’t perform any type-checking on TypeScript code. To optionally use type-checking run:\n\n```bash\nyarn add fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin\n```\n\nThen modify the webpack config to use it as a plugin:\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require(\"@rails/webpacker\");\nconst ForkTSCheckerWebpackPlugin = require(\"fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, {\n  plugins: [new ForkTSCheckerWebpackPlugin()],\n});\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\nTo enable CSS support in your application, add following packages:\n\n```bash\nyarn add css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin css-minimizer-webpack-plugin\n```\n\noptionally, add the css extension to webpack config for easy resolution.\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst customConfig = {\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: ['.css']\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)\n```\n\nTo enable postcss, sass or less support, add css support first and\nthen add the relevant pre-processors:\n\n#### Postcss\n\n```bash\nyarn add postcss-loader\n```\n\n#### Sass\n\n```bash\nyarn add sass sass-loader\n```\n\n#### Less\n\n```bash\nyarn add less less-loader\n```\n\n#### Stylus\n\n```bash\nyarn add stylus stylus-loader\n```\n\n#### React\n\nReact is supported and you just need to add relevant packages,\n\n```bash\nyarn add react react-dom @babel/preset-react\n```\n\nif you are using typescript, update your `tsconfig.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"declaration\": false,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"es6\", \"dom\"],\n    \"module\": \"es6\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"jsx\": \"react\",\n    \"noEmit\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\"**/*.spec.ts\", \"node_modules\", \"vendor\", \"public\"],\n  \"compileOnSave\": false\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on React props hydration and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), see the article\n[Rails/Webpacker React Integration Options](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/docs/rails-webpacker-react-integration-options.md)\nin the [ShakaCode/react_on_rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) repo.\n\n#### Other frameworks\n\nPlease follow webpack integration guide for relevant framework or library,\n\n1. [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader#install)\n2. [Angular](https://v2.angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html#!#configure-webpack)\n3. [Vue](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/)\n\nFor example to add Vue support:\n```js\n// config/webpack/rules/vue.js\nconst VueLoaderPlugin = require('vue-loader/lib/plugin')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.vue$/,\n        loader: 'vue-loader'\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [new VueLoaderPlugin()]\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// config/webpack/base.js\nconst { webpackConfig, merge } = require('@rails/webpacker')\nconst vueConfig = require('./rules/vue')\n\nmodule.exports = merge(webpackConfig, vueConfig)\n```\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified, per the binstub source\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# Compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified, per `lib/tasks/webpacker/compile.rake`\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\n# check your Gemfile for version restrictions\nbundle update webpacker\n\n# overwrite your changes to the default install files and revert any unwanted changes from the install\nrails webpacker:install\n\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn upgrade webpack-dev-server --latest\n\n# Or to install the latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\nAlso, consult the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for additional upgrade links.\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/packs/entrypoints/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/packs`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/packs`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend # packs are in frontend/packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output,\nas you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading.\nDuring production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n### Additional paths\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `additional_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should look up when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nadditional_paths: ['app/assets', 'vendor/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\nWhen compiling assets for production on a remote server, such as a continuous integration environment, it's recommended to use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install NPM packages on the remote host to ensure that the installed packages match the `yarn.lock` file.\n\nIf you are using a CDN setup, webpacker will use the configured [asset host](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#rails-general-configuration) value to prefix URLs for images or font icons which are included inside JS code or CSS. It is possible to override this value during asset compilation by setting the `WEBPACKER_ASSET_HOST` environment variable.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSee the doc page for [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!

makes it easy to use the JavaScript pre-processor and bundler\n[webpack 4.x.x+](https://webpack.js.org/)\nto manage application-like JavaScript in Rails. It coexists with the asset pipeline,\nas the primary purpose for webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or\neven JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).\n\nHowever, it is possible to use Webpacker for CSS, images and fonts assets as well,\nin which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.\n\n**NOTE:** The master branch now hosts the code for v5.x.x.

Sass and CSS\n- Images and fonts\n- PostCSS - Auto-Prefixer\n- Asset compression, source-maps, and minification\n- CDN support\n- React, Angular, Elm and Vue support out-of-the-box\n- Rails view helpers\n- Extensible and configurable\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can either add Webpacker during setup of a new Rails 5.1+ application\nusing new `--webpack` option:\n\n```bash\n# Available Rails 5.1+\nrails new myapp --webpack\n```\n\nOr add it to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\ngem 'webpacker', '~> 5.x'\n\n# OR if you prefer to use master\ngem 'webpacker', git: 'https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git'\nyarn add https://github.com/rails/webpacker.git\nyarn add core-js regenerator-runtime\n```\n\nFinally, run the following to install Webpacker:\n\n```bash\nbundle\nbundle exec rails webpacker:install\n\n# OR (on rails version < 5.0)\nbundle exec rake webpacker:install\n```\n\nOptional: To fix [\"unmet peer dependency\" warnings](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1078),\n\n```bash\nyarn upgrade\n```\n\nWhen `package.json` and/or `yarn.lock` changes, such as when pulling down changes to your local environment in a team settings, be sure to keep your NPM packages up-to-date:\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can start writing modern ES6-flavored JavaScript apps right away:\n\n```yml\napp/javascript:\n  ├── packs:\n  │   # only webpack entry files here\n  │   └── application.js\n  │   └── application.css\n  └── src:\n  │   └── my_component.js\n  └── stylesheets:\n  │   └── my_styles.css\n  └── images:\n      └── logo.svg\n```\n\nIn `/packs/application.js`, include this at the top of the file:\n\n```js\nimport 'core-js/stable'\nimport 'regenerator-runtime/runtime'\n```\n\nYou can then link the JavaScript pack in Rails views using the `javascript_pack_tag` helper.\nIf you have styles imported in your pack file, you can link them by using `stylesheet_pack_tag`:\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>\n<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>\n```\n\nIf you want to link a static asset for `<link rel=\"prefetch\">` or `<img />` tag, you\ncan use the `asset_pack_path` helper:\n\n```erb\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'application.css' %>\" />\n<img src=\"<%= asset_pack_path 'images/logo.svg' %>\" />\n```\n\nIf you are using new webpack 4 split chunks API, then consider using `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag` helper, which creates html\ntags for a pack and all the dependent chunks.\n\n```erb\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar', 'map', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>\n\n<script src=\"/packs/vendor-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/calendar~runtime-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/calendar-1016838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/map~runtime-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n<script src=\"/packs/map-16838bab065ae1e314.js\" data-turbolinks-track=\"reload\"></script>\n```\n\n**Important:** Pass all your pack names when using `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag`\nhelper otherwise you will get duplicated chunks on the page.\n\n```erb\n<%# DO %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar', 'map' %>\n\n<%# DON'T %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'calendar' %>\n<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'map' %>\n```\n\n**Note:** In order for your styles or static assets files to be available in your view,\nyou would need to link them in your \"pack\" or entry file.\n\n### Development\n\nWebpacker ships with two binstubs: `./bin/webpack` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.\nBoth are thin wrappers around the standard `webpack.js` and `webpack-dev-server.js`\nexecutables to ensure that the right configuration files and environmental variables\nare loaded based on your environment.\n\nIn development, Webpacker compiles on demand rather than upfront by default. This\nhappens when you refer to any of the pack assets using the Webpacker helper methods.\nThis means that you don't have to run any separate processes. Compilation errors are logged\nto the standard Rails log.\n\nIf you want to use live code reloading, or you have enough JavaScript that on-demand compilation is too slow, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` or `ruby ./bin/webpack-dev-server`. Windows users will need to run these commands\nin a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s`. This process will watch for changes\nin the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files and automatically reload the browser to match.\n\n```bash\n# webpack dev server\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# watcher\n./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress\n\n# standalone build\n./bin/webpack\n```\n\nOnce you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically start proxying all\nwebpack asset requests to this server. When you stop the server, it'll revert back to\non-demand compilation.\n\nYou can use environment variables as options supported by\n[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) in the\nform `WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_<OPTION>`. Please note that these environmental\nvariables will always take precedence over the ones already set in the\nconfiguration file, and that the _same_ environmental variables must\nbe available to the `rails server` process.\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=example.com WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_INLINE=true WEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOT=false ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nBy default, the webpack dev server listens on `localhost` in development for security purposes.\nHowever, if you want your app to be available over local LAN IP or a VM instance like vagrant,\nyou can set the `host` when running `./bin/webpack-dev-server` binstub:\n\n```bash\nWEBPACKER_DEV_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n**Note:** You need to allow webpack-dev-server host as an allowed origin for `connect-src` if you are running your application in a restrict CSP environment (like Rails 5.2+). This can be done in Rails 5.2+ in the CSP initializer `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` with a snippet like this:\n\n```ruby\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n    policy.connect_src :self, :https, 'http://localhost:3035', 'ws://localhost:3035' if Rails.env.development?\n  end\n```\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to prefix `ruby` when running these binstubs on Windows\n\n### Webpack Configuration\n\nSee [docs/webpack](docs/webpack.md) for modifying webpack configuration and loaders.\n\n### Custom Rails environments\n\nOut of the box Webpacker ships with - development, test and production environments in `config/webpacker.yml` however, in most production apps extra environments are needed as part of deployment workflow. Webpacker supports this out of the box from version 3.4.0+ onwards.\n\nYou can choose to define additional environment configurations in webpacker.yml,\n\n```yml\nstaging:\n  <<: *default\n\n  # Production depends on precompilation of packs prior to booting for performance.\n  compile: false\n\n  # Cache manifest.json for performance\n  cache_manifest: true\n\n  # Compile staging packs to a separate directory\n  public_output_path: packs-staging\n```\n\nor, Webpacker will use production environment as a fallback environment for loading configurations. Please note, `NODE_ENV` can either be set to `production`, `development` or `test`.\nThis means you don't need to create additional environment files inside `config/webpacker/*` and instead use webpacker.yml to load different configurations using `RAILS_ENV`.\n\nFor example, the below command will compile assets in production mode but will use staging configurations from `config/webpacker.yml` if available or use fallback production environment configuration:\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=staging bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nAnd, this will compile in development mode and load configuration for cucumber environment\nif defined in webpacker.yml or fallback to production configuration\n\n```bash\nRAILS_ENV=cucumber NODE_ENV=development bundle exec rails assets:precompile\n```\n\nPlease note, binstubs compiles in development mode however rake tasks\ncompiles in production mode.\n\n```bash\n# Compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified\n./bin/webpack\n./bin/webpack-dev-server\n\n# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified\nbundle exec rails assets:precompile\nbundle exec rails webpacker:compile\n```\n\n### Upgrading\n\nYou can run following commands to upgrade Webpacker to the latest stable version. This process involves upgrading the gem and related JavaScript packages:\n\n```bash\nbundle update webpacker\nrails webpacker:binstubs\nyarn upgrade @rails/webpacker --latest\nyarn upgrade webpack-dev-server --latest\n\n# Or to install the latest release (including pre-releases)\nyarn add @rails/webpacker@next\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\nWebpacker ships with basic out-of-the-box integration. You can see a list of available commands/tasks by running `bundle exec rails webpacker`.\n\nIncluded install integrations:\n\n- [React](./docs/integrations.md#React)\n- [Angular with TypeScript](./docs/integrations.md#Angular-with-TypeScript)\n- [Vue](./docs/integrations.md#Vue)\n- [Elm](./docs/integrations.md#Elm)\n- [Svelte](./docs/integrations.md#Svelte)\n- [Stimulus](./docs/integrations.md#Stimulus)\n- [CoffeeScript](./docs/integrations.md#CoffeeScript)\n- [Typescript](./docs/typescript.md)\n- [Erb](./docs/integrations.md#Erb)\n\nSee [Integrations](./docs/integrations.md) for further details.\n\n## Paths\n\nBy default, Webpacker ships with simple conventions for where the JavaScript\napp files and compiled webpack bundles will go in your Rails app.\nAll these options are configurable from `config/webpacker.yml` file.\n\nThe configuration for what webpack is supposed to compile by default rests\non the convention that every file in `app/javascript/packs/*`**(default)**\nor whatever path you set for `source_entry_path` in the `webpacker.yml` configuration\nis turned into their own output files (or entry points, as webpack calls it). Therefore you don't want to put anything inside `packs` directory that you do not want to be\nan entry file. As a rule of thumb, put all files you want to link in your views inside\n\"packs\" directory and keep everything else under `app/javascript`.\n\nSuppose you want to change the source directory from `app/javascript`\nto `frontend` and output to `assets/packs`. This is how you would do it:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\nsource_path: frontend\nsource_entry_path: packs\npublic_output_path: assets/packs # outputs to => public/assets/packs\n```\n\nSimilarly you can also control and configure `webpack-dev-server` settings from `config/webpacker.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# config/webpacker.yml\ndevelopment:\n  dev_server:\n    host: localhost\n    port: 3035\n```\n\nIf you have `hmr` turned to true, then the `stylesheet_pack_tag` generates no output, as you will want to configure your styles to be inlined in your JavaScript for hot reloading. During production and testing, the `stylesheet_pack_tag` will create the appropriate HTML tags.\n\n### Resolved\n\nIf you are adding Webpacker to an existing app that has most of the assets inside\n`app/assets` or inside an engine, and you want to share that\nwith webpack modules, you can use the `additional_paths`\noption available in `config/webpacker.yml`. This lets you\nadd additional paths that webpack should lookup when resolving modules:\n\n```yml\nadditional_paths: ['app/assets']\n```\n\nYou can then import these items inside your modules like so:\n\n```js\n// Note it's relative to parent directory i.e. app/assets\nimport 'stylesheets/main'\nimport 'images/rails.png'\n```\n\n**Note:** Please be careful when adding paths here otherwise it\nwill make the compilation slow, consider adding specific paths instead of\nwhole parent directory if you just need to reference one or two modules\n\n## Deployment\n\nWebpacker hooks up a new `webpacker:compile` task to `assets:precompile`, which gets run whenever you run `assets:precompile`. If you are not using Sprockets, `webpacker:compile` is automatically aliased to `assets:precompile`. Similar to sprockets both rake tasks will compile packs in production mode but will use `RAILS_ENV` to load configuration from `config/webpacker.yml` (if available).\n\nWhen compiling assets for production on a remote server, such as a continuous integration environment, it's recommended to use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install NPM packages on the remote host to ensure that the installed packages match the `yarn.lock` file.\n\n## Docs\n\n- [Development](https://github.com/rails/webpacker#development)\n  - [Webpack](./docs/webpack.md)\n  - [Webpack-dev-server](./docs/webpack-dev-server.md)\n  - [Environment Variables](./docs/env.md)\n  - [Folder Structure](./docs/folder-structure.md)\n  - [Assets](./docs/assets.md) - [CSS, Sass and SCSS](./docs/css.md) - [ES6](./docs/es6.md), [Target browsers](./docs/target.md)\n    - [Props](./docs/props.md)\n    - [Typescript](./docs/typescript.md)\n  - [Yarn](./docs/yarn.md)\n  - [Misc](./docs/misc.md)\n- [Deployment](./docs/deployment.md)\n  - [Docker](./docs/docker.md)\n  - [Using in Rails engines](./docs/engines.md)\n  - [Webpacker on Cloud9](./docs/cloud9.md)\n- [Testing](./docs/testing.md)\n- [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md)\n- [v3 to v4 Upgrade Guide](./docs/v4-upgrade.md)\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Code Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/webpacker)\n\nWe encourage you to contribute to Webpacker!
